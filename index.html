		<p>dear yuqi,<br>&emsp;&emsp;to preface this message, i apologize for not writing this by hand. i have so much to say and so little time to write it down, so i decided to type it instead. please forgive me.</p>
		<br>
		<p><b>part i: before you</b><br>&emsp;&emsp;i’m not friendly. even to some of my friends, i’m not friendly. you’ve seen it. when you first met me, i had on this invisible mask that hid my emotions. even your first impression of me on instagram was that i seemed intimidating and non-chalant, but not by chance. i purposely do this to hide—to camouflage myself from the world. why? maybe i have some insecurity or trauma i’ve been oblivious to my entire life. but honestly, i think it's just because i don’t really like the person that i am.<br>&emsp;&emsp;as you know, last summer, i went on a trip with the people who had been my closest friends for a long time, and i made some depressing revelations. i realized that i don’t really like some of the people that i’ve decided to surround myself with. however, it wasn’t the friendships i had with these people that bothered me, it was the nature of the friendships themselves: i had allowed these people to take the worst parts of themselves and smother it all over me until it became my skin. i had let my guard down, not realizing that i was changing, and not the way i wanted to.<br>&emsp;&emsp;we’ve talked about how people are how their friends are. i said before that i partially disagree, because in some ways, i was how my friends are. and i admit that i was like them in a manner that i’m not proud of.<br>&emsp;&emsp;by the end of the summer, i had spent plenty of time reflecting on who i was and how my past had molded me. i was sick thinking about how easily i let people control me and define who i am to others. i resented the past. i was ready for the future. i was ready for a change. i was ready for usc.</p>

		<p><b>part 2: after you</b><br>&emsp;&emsp;august 21st. the first day i met you in the corner of that dining hall. i had asked for a change, but i didn’t realize you would be the catalyst. nothing could’ve prepared me for what happened during welcome week. i think we can both agree that our welcome week was one of the longest weeks of our lives. regarding the events that happened during that week, i want to apologize again for not speaking up sooner; i was after a change, and i thought other people were too. but now, i’ve realized that some people just don’t want to change, and they don’t deserve a chance to.<br>&emsp;&emsp;the first month at usc (after welcome week) with you was probably some of the most fun i’ve ever had. you blew me away. to me, you were this multi-talented, quadrilingual, ultra-charismatic, beautiful girl who showed more care and interest in me than some of my decade long friends did. you took my mask and burnt it so that i would never need to wear it again.<br>&emsp;&emsp;i still remember hearing you sing for the first time. i remember being confused for a second because i thought the vocals were playing with the backtrack until i looked at you and realized that angelic sound was coming from you. i was in complete awe, staring at you with my mouth open like an idiot. <i>is this girl real? did she fall from heaven?</i> to be completely honest, you were never just a friend or a love interest to me, you were someone that i looked up to. i had asked for a change, and at that moment, i realized that i had found my mold.<br>&emsp;&emsp;i’m glad that we became friends during welcome week, because during every party we went to, i could sense guys looking your way, and i would always creep one step closer. i think i did a good job of repelling your huzz. maybe there was a guy out there in the crowd who would’ve been better, but there’s no way i would’ve let that happen. i had become protective of you, possessive even, long before we started dating. i dedicated my time, my effort, and my focus to you, not just because i was interested in you, but because i had this idea of you in my head that i couldn’t let anyone harm you, which meant that no one could have you as long as you weren’t mine.<br>&emsp;&emsp;over time, my attraction to you only grew intensely. our facetimes when i was in vancouver, our one-on-one lunches, going out alone, spending time together; despite all these positive sounding phrases, i was scared. i was terrified. i was falling in love. your friendship meant everything to me, and i didn’t want my feelings to ruin something so delicate. i knew we wouldn’t be friends if i confessed and you didn’t feel the same way. which is why i knew we couldn’t be friends. so when i confessed, i risked losing everything: my change, my friend, my heart, my hope. that singular second after i asked you to be my girlfriend, i felt it stretch across the universe. every cell in my body was painstakingly aware of its minuteness and insignificance in the world. i could feel a black hole devouring the butterflies i had in my stomach. and when you nodded and said yes,<br>&emsp;&emsp;the feeling i had cannot be described but can only be abstracted to the big bang.</p>

		<p><b>part 3: after love</b><br>&emsp;&emsp;our love is special. it’s different. i had loved you before, but when i was able to show you my affection in more ways, it morphed into something clearer, something so inherently innocent that somehow felt taboo. because you had been my friend before, i was intimidated. i couldn’t make a move, i couldn’t express what i wanted to do because i was too shy. i would like to formally apologize again for having our first kiss in your friend’s berkeley dorm. i could’ve done a lot better, but i still don’t regret it.<br>&emsp;&emsp;your love is so tender, so soft, so warm, it invited me in and i couldn’t help but fall deeper and deeper every day. whenever i look at you, i get lost in those deep brown eyes, slipping into your soul and paralyzing me for an instant. your hair, how perfectly it falls on your shoulders, highlighting your delicate features. your arms, an extension of your grace, wrapped around mine. your hands, a cinderella fit to mine when interlocked. your lips, so elegant and irresistible. your scent—to fucking die for. your voice, soothing to the eardrum; your song, can be heard by deaf ears. your demeanor, so calming and attractive. your sneeze, an overdose of cuteness. your laugh, i could listen to forever. your legs, wrapped around mine; our skin, airtight; our bodies pressed together. when we are connected, i feel like we are one, like nothing can pull us apart, like i am yours and you are mine, like i am the yin to your yang, like we are floating in space for eternity, completely ignoring the laws of physics. when we’re together, it kills me to leave even when i know i’ll see you the next day. i miss you. i. miss. you. constantly and consistently. every day, every hour, every minute, every second, every millisecond, every microsecond we’re apart, i’m missing you. i’m hopelessly in love with you. if you asked me to bury a village, i’d ask how deep. if you asked me to take over a country, i’d ask which one. i would do absolutely anything. anything for the girl i fell head over heels for.<br>&emsp;&emsp;to end my message, i want to pose a question: how can anyone prove anything at all? how can i even prove my own existence. philosophers and scientists alike have been pondering this question for an eternity and it seems we’re no closer to answer. i don’t have an answer to the question. i don’t think anyone ever will. but despite this conundrum, there is one thing that this world and i have agreed unquestionably exists:<p style="text-align: center;">I Love You.<br><br>from your future husband</p></p>
